The goal of this analysis is to find out which health indicators are associated heart disease and will potentially be useful in predicting whether or not someone develop heart disease. Our dataset is a subset of data collected from the CDC’s 2015-Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a telephone survey used to collect data on the health and condition of the residents of the United States of America. The data contains the binary outcome of heart disease or heart attack status along with different health indicators that could be useful in predicting heart disease, such as BMI, smoking status, and age. Most of the health indicator variables have binary responses to a health status or condition, with BMI being the quantitative variable in the data.\nMETHODS: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and it is a subset of data from the 2015 CDC’s telephone survey across the 50 states. The dataset used only includes health indicators that might be useful for predicting heart disease status across the nation. The dataset was downloaded and read in as a CSV file and the dimensions, header, and footer were all checked to ensure the data was properly displaying. The str function was used to look at the structure of the data and see that all of variables are numerical values. The summary function allows us to take a closer look at the variables and see the summary statistics of each variable and any missing values that might occur in the data. No missing values are observed and most variable are binary-categorical variables. All numerical-categorical variables are transformed using ifelse statements to their corresponding category using the Kaggle legend to make the responses more intuitive. The clean dataset was then restricted to variables that would seem to have an association including the new character variables and BMI(duplicates were removed). Exploratory data analysis was run on variables of interest and it is noted that BMI has a max of 98. A BMI of 98 seems to be a suspicious value because most BMI charts only list 30 and above as the highest BMI category. Using medical journals, I was able to verify that BMI values can exceed 100, but the majority of people do not fall into that category. Additionally, I calculated the proportion of individuals that had a BMI greater than 40 in our dataset was 4% and those greater than 50 was 0.8%, so it seems to be reasonable that these BMI values are not errors and will be included in our analysis. Exploratory graphs were created for variables of interest using ggplot and summary tables were created using summarize and kable function.\nDimensions of dataset: 253680 x 22 Header/Footer data is displaying correctly All variable types are numerical Summary tells us dataset is well-maintained; no missing values BMI max is 98,which is questionable\n\n#dim(hd)\n#head(hd)\n#tail(hd)\n#str(hd)\n#summary(hd)\n\nTake a look at non-binary variable and see that they are categorical, but need to use Kaggle legend to transform into

For the most part all the variables that seem to put you in a healthier category showed a decrease in heart disease. Although, the data did seem to have an exception were we show that an increase in heavy use of alcohol showed a decrease in heart diease, but this trend need more research because the data might have been skewed due to small sample size in the heavy use alcohol category. All variables seemed to be associated with heart disease and deserve to be furthered studied, but from the list of variables of interest heavy use of alcohol and fruit eating status seemed to be the least associated between the variables."
